    "Answer:Yes, my friend is correct. Shuffling the training set is important because it prevents the model from learning patterns based on the order of images. If all dog images are grouped together, the model may become biased toward dogs during training, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Shuffling helps ensure that each mini-batch has a mix of classes, improving the model's ability to learn effectively."

    "Answer:Layers in a deep architecture need to be non-linear to allow the model to learn complex patterns in the data. If all layers were linear, the entire network would behave like a single linear transformation, regardless of its depth. Non-linear activation functions, like ReLU or sigmoid, enable the network to combine features in complex ways, helping it capture intricate relationships and improve its ability to solve difficult tasks like image classification or natural language processing."

    "Convolutional Layer: This layer applies filters to the input image to detect features like edges, textures, and shapes. It learns spatial hierarchies of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling Layer: Often used after convolutional layers, pooling (like max pooling) reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, which helps decrease computation and control overfitting while retaining important features.\n",

Q1: A bakery bakes 120 cupcakes daily. If each customer buys 4 cupcakes, how many customers can be served in a day?

Q2: If the bakery increases production by 50%, how many total cupcakes will they bake per day?

Q3: Now, if each cupcake costs $2 and a customer buys 6 cupcakes, how much will the customer pay?

Q4: Assume the bakery spends $0.50 per cupcake on ingredients. If they bake 180 cupcakes in a day, what is their total cost for ingredients?

We can use MSE (Mean Squared Error) for Regression; Precision, Recall, and ROC (Receiver operating characteristics) for a Classification Problem along with Absolute Error. In a similar way, Bias and Variance help us in parameter tuning and deciding better-fitted models among several built.</p> \n",

    "<p>Bias is one type of error that occurs due to wrong assumptions about data such as assuming data is linear when in reality, data follows a complex function. On the other hand, variance gets introduced with high sensitivity to variations in training data. This also is one type of error since we want to make our model robust against noise. There are two types of error in machine learning. Reducible error and Irreducible error. Bias and Variance come under reducible error.</p>\n",

    "<p>Bias is simply defined as the inability of the model because of that there is some difference or error occurring between the model’s predicted value and the actual value. These differences between actual or expected values and the predicted values are known as error or bias error or error due to bias. Bias is a systematic error that occurs due to wrong assumptions in the machine learning process.</p>\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Use a more complex model: One of the main reasons for high bias is the very simplified model. it will not be able to capture the complexity of the data. In such cases, we can make our mode more complex by increasing the number of hidden layers in the case of a deep neural network. Or we can use a more complex model like Polynomial regression for non-linear datasets, CNN for image processing, and RNN for sequence learning.</li>\n",

    "<li>Reduce Regularization of the model: Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. if the model has a high bias, reducing the strength of regularization or removing it altogether can help to improve its performance.</li>\n",

    "<p>Variance is the measure of spread in data from its mean position. In machine learning variance is the amount by which the performance of a predictive model changes when it is trained on different subsets of the training data. More specifically, variance is the variability of the model that how much it is sensitive to another subset of the training dataset. i.e. how much it can adjust on the new subset of the training dataset.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<li><strong>High variance:</strong> High variance means that the model is very sensitive to changes in the training data and can result in significant changes in the estimate of the target function when trained on different subsets of data from the same distribution.

    "<li><strong>Feature selection:</strong> By choosing the only relevant feature will decrease the model’s complexity. and it can reduce the variance error.</li>\n",
